# K-Means Clustering (AI & ML Internship)

## 📌 Objective
Perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering and evaluate cluster quality.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset
Mall Customer Segmentation dataset from Kaggle.

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Selected key features: Annual Income and Spending Score.
3. Used the Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters.
4. Applied K-Means clustering.
5. Visualized clusters using scatter plots.
6. Evaluated clustering using Silhouette Score.

## 📈 Results
- Optimal clusters found using Elbow Method.
- Customers grouped into segments based on income and spending behavior.
- Silhouette Score used to measure clustering quality.

## 📚 Concepts Learned
- Unsupervised Learning
